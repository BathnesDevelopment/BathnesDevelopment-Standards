# Project Name

Write a project description.  Remember to also set a description in GitHub.

## What is it?

Provide a decent amount of background history

TODO: Give some background details of the project, how it came about (the requirements), who it was developed by, and who uses it.  Can also include some details of future development and whether it is likely to be updated.  Should be useful information to anyone looking at similar applications.

## Technologies used

List the high level technologies.  Provide links if necessary. Associated descriptions can also be used to cover any design decisions and why those technologies were used.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
|      |             |

## Build

Describe the build instructions.  What development environment is required?  This may include dependencies that need to be installed prior to build.

## Deployment

Give details of the best options for deploying the solution.  Full instructions can be provided elsewhere (documentation folder) if necessary.

## Usage

Write usage instructions.  Full user guides should be in the documentation folder and linked to from here.  

## Third party licensing

List any relevant licences.  List any third party plugins and components used and their licensing details.

These may also include the licence details on data that is used within the code, which may restrict who can effectively use the code.  Even where that data isn't included as part of the code.

| Name | Description | Link | Licence |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ------- |

## Licence

We should generally be using a open licence.  The Government Digital Service chose the MIT licence instead of Open Government as it is more suited to code.  So unless otherwise restricted, do the same:

- On creating the repository in GitHub select to use an MIT licence.
- If not, copy the Licence.txt file from this repository and link to it.

Original code licensed with [MIT Licence](Licence.txt)
